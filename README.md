# SpaceY?

Week 1 Project

Requirements achieved:
-Each section of the webpage is wrapped in the correct semantic tags.
-CSS absolute positioning used to overlay text on an image.
-Flexbox used to create a flexible and responsive layout for the header, main and footer.
-All image elements are correctly implemented.

Stretch goals implemented:
-Back to top button fixed at the lower right corner.
-Smooth scrolling for internal links that direct to different sections of the page.
-Hover effect on buttons and on the nav section.
-Social media icons on the footer.

Most challenging parts to implement:
-Sizing the back to top button to the right size and getting it into the right position.
-Using flexbox to place elements into the desired spaces on the page.
